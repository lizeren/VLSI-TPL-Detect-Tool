# Testing TPL 

Currently I have two TPLs: Pwgen and a cpp program that draws ascii cat and dog
  
## How to use
```bash
make
```
Move the executable `draw_test` and `pwgen_exec` from this direcotry to `dataset/dataset2/1_binary/candidate` folder of Libam. Move `password_generator`to   `dataset/dataset2/1_binary/target`
